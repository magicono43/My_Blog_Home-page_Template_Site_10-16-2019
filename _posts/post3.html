        <p class="lead">I would not count this as my third "practical" program/script, because it is mostly made as a support script for my second, but I still think it's should be separate since it solves a decently annoying and tedious problem as well.</p>

        <p>I made this script primarily as a supporting script for my audio recording script, but felt it would be best to keep it separate, as it would allow more flexibility later on and this could be used for more than just this particular application.</p>
		
		<p>It's really no more complex than the script it is meant to support, the main "complex" part of it when it takes all of the files names of the input folder and puts them into an array that will be iterated on and used later on in the process, when each file is about to be edited in Audacity.</p>
		
		<p>There is really not that much to say about this one, but I have definitely found it pretty useful, this one is actually fully automated in some sense after you start running it, the biggest down-side with how it runs is that you can't really do anything on the computer that is running it because it is often changing the focus of windows, which could easily mess up the script if you change focus around every few seconds. There is also very little "polish" that checks for problems and resolves them during running, it's either running properly or it is not and needs to be reset, but it is definitely very useful and time saving as it is.</p>
