        <p class="lead">This was my first "pratical" problem solving program/script that I made and felt some amount of pride and sense of quality from, written in the AutoHotKey language and compiler.</p>

        <p>I made this script because I wanted the ability to save a collection of a given artist's work without having to go through clicking hundreds or even thousands of times just to archive one artist.</p>
		
		<p>So what I did was make this fairly simple web-scrapping script that would go through the tagged names of a given artist on a specific Booru image site and save every image until it got to the end of their collection. Also, I made arrays that would allow me to put multiple artist tag names into it that would be iterated through and I could essentially put as many artists as I wanted in a given session and leave the script running while I did other things and just check on it hours later.</p>
		
		<p>The tools and commands I used to make this script were ultimately very simple and basic compared to others avaliable. I used the JQuery library very often to get specific information from the DOM as well as a few commands that allowed manipulation with the IE window as well as the DOM. Everything else was mostly basic loops and if-statements with multiple functions to make things cleaner. Probably the most complex thing was making sure I was getting the closest to the "source" resolution files and images that I possibly could, this required a lot of searching around in the HTML code to find what I needed, consistently as well.</p>
		
		<p>There are still a lot of things that could definitely be improved in this first script of mine, but overall I was very excited and proud when I finally finished working on this, it gave me the confidence to continue on the path I was on, learning through DOING and solving practical problems I found during my daily routine that I felt could be automated and streamlined to be much less time consuming and tedious.</p>
